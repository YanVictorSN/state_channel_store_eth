# 🏗 State Channel Delivery Store

🧪 This build is a work in progress of a delivery state channel store. 

⚙️ Built using NextJS, RainbowKit, Hardhat, Wagmi, Viem, Supabase and Typescript.

## Features

* We are using Supabase as a backend for data persistence and off-chain transactions.
* We sing and verify messages between the owner and client.
* We emit events to keep track this on-chain.

## Implementations to be made.
[ ] Create a QR Code to sign the last transaction between delivery address and customer.

[ ] Move the backend to a decentralized server.

[ ] Improve the code and the UI.
